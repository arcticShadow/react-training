Why use React?

React is a tool that makes our life easier. There is nothing special about it, there are a number of other tools that do a similar job. Do answer the question of why use a tool like react, consider, digging a whole in a garden. In soft soil, you can use your hands to move hte soil. you get a bit dirty, but the job gets done. If the soil is actually hard clay, it becomes much much harder to dig the hole. but if you use a spade, (a tool) it is easier to dig the whole - as as an advantage, you no longer get dirty. So you made the job easier, and better at the same time. 

React fit the same description - we can do the same stuff without it, its just much harder.

Why React? Why not? This is often a decision made by people with a bit of technical proficiency with react. Its easier to use a tool you already know, then to use a new tool, that is equally as good.  

Other tools similar to react, include Vue, Angular, Svelte and more.
