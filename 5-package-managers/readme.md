Registries - The npm registry is a massive collection of open source library's and projects that have been bundled and built, ready for distribution. Think of it as a place to get code that you don't need to write and test. 

Warning: the registry is a free for all. Never blindly trust a package that you find. Try not to be lazy and use packages for everything, 

Discuss security issues like left-pad and if someone publishes a malicious version of a package to a hacked package

Different package managers

npm - the Original package manager - unless you have a reason to to, use this.
yarn - The first alternate Package manager to NPM - Has been through many iterations of the  years, just release V4 as stable. 
pnpm -  Was intended to be better than Yarn, and added new features that yarn didn't have. Yarn however kept growing. pnpm and yarn are very similar in there feature set, and each offers a slightly different set of features at the more advanced level. 

When to use? 
If you not sure what to use, use npm. 

if your starting a new project, never use yarn from the npm registry - its the old version. UIf you want to use yarn, researh how to use the new version of yarn (v4 at time of writing)
