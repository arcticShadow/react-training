# Setup

To work on webdev you need a basic setup on you computer. 

* You must have access to a command line
* you must have access to NodeJS
* You must have access to an editor - VSCode will be used in this guide. 

It is outside the scope of this guide to setup these tools. Mabey you could ask a peer for help if required?
